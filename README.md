# Bomb The Plane

An old game, two players draw their plane in 10*10 or other scale grids, then guess each other's plane coordinate, player who first find plane's head coordinate win the game. It's a old program, I code it When I'm in college.

It works like this:

setup the game:

game play:

![Alt text](/doc/game_play_7.png?raw=true "game play")

# Build
